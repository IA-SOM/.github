## Project Description

This project aims to develop an intelligent query optimizer inspired by Neo, utilizing a different Machine Learning algorithm to generate efficient query execution plans. Query optimization is crucial for enhancing the performance of relational database management systems.

## Project Objectives

1. **Analysis of Query Optimizers:** Deep dive into the workings of existing query optimizers, focusing on Neo as the primary reference.
2. **Selection of Machine Learning Algorithm:** Choose a suitable Machine Learning algorithm for generating query execution plans.
3. **Model Design:** Design a Machine Learning model capable of learning to optimize queries based on existing optimizers and adapting to underlying data models.
4. **Implementation:** Develop the query optimizer using the chosen Machine Learning algorithm, following software development best practices.
5. **Evaluation and Comparison:** Evaluate the performance of the developed query optimizer by comparing its results with Neo and other existing query optimizers.
6. **Documentation and Reporting:** Document the development process, obtained results, and drawn conclusions in a detailed report.
